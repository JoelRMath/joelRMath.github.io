# Joel R. Pradines, Ph.D. 👋

**Biomathematics | Mathematics | Statistics | Programming**

I specialize in the conceptualization and implementation of rigorous mathematical models to decode complex systems. 
I possess a good ability to rapidly achieve post-graduate depth across diverse mathematical and scientific disciplines to translate complex
phenomena into actionable insights.
